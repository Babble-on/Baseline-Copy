Scripts built for work which copys a zipped directory containing a PDF baseline of service areas to a local machine.  After the inital copy completes a sound plays indicating it is safe to remove the external HD and move to the next local machine.  The script contiues to run and unpack the baseline to the correct directory.  Another sound is played upon completion of that process to indicate the entire copy is complete.

A simple .hta GUI provides a Menu I place on the users desktop.  Clicking one of the buttons kicks off the area specific script to copy the correct PDF driectory.

An External drive is also needed to house the baselines and contain the nessesacry files for extraction.
